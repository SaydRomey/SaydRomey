**[ft_transcendance](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_transcendance)**

I am currently working on  42's final project before completing the common core.  
A real-time multiplayer web application combining authentication, chat, and a Pong-inspired game,  
built with modern web technologies.

## Currently Working On
**[ft_transcendance](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_transcendance)**

I am currently working on  42's final project before completing the common core.  
A real-time multiplayer web application combining authentication, chat, and a Pong-inspired game, built with modern web technologies.

The **42 Common Core** is a rigorous, peer-driven curriculum focusing on low-level programming, algorithms, and systems development.
