# Hello World!
I'm Ced, a programming student at [42 Québec](https://www.42quebec.com)  

## Currently Working On
I am currently working on **[ft_transcendance](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_transcendance)**,  
42's final project before completing the common core.  
A real-time multiplayer web application combining authentication, chat, and a Pong-inspired game, built with modern web technologies.

The **42 Common Core** is a rigorous, peer-driven curriculum focusing on low-level programming, algorithms, and systems development.

## Completed Projects from 42 Common Core

- **[Libft](https://github.com/SaydRomey/libft)**: A custom implementation of essential C library functions.
- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/SaydRomey/get_next_line)**: A program to read a line from a file descriptor, one at a time.
- **[ft_printf](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_printf)**: A recreation of the `printf` function with advanced formatting capabilities.
- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/SaydRomey/B2BR)**: Setting up a secure virtual server environment with Linux.
- **[pipex](https://github.com/SaydRomey/pipex)**: A reproduction of the Unix `pipe` and redirection functionalities.
- **[push_swap](https://github.com/SaydRomey/push_swap)**: Sorting algorithm project using two stacks and a limited set of operations.
- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/SaydRomey/Philosopher)**: A concurrent programming exercise exploring threads and mutexes.
- **[FdF](https://github.com/SaydRomey/FdF)**: A 3D wireframe representation of landscapes using the MLX library.
- **[minishell](https://github.com/SaydRomey/Minishell)**: A functional shell implementation in C, supporting basic Unix commands.
- **[cub3D](https://github.com/SaydRomey/cub3D)**: A raycasting-based 3D game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.
- **[NetPractice](https://github.com/SaydRomey/netpractice)**: An introduction to networking concepts and configurations.
- **[ft_irc](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_irc)**: Building an IRC server from scratch with C++.
- **[Inception](https://github.com/SaydRomey/inception)**: Setting up a Docker-based multi-service application.
- **[CPP Modules](https://github.com/SaydRomey/CPP)**: A deep dive into object-oriented programming using C++98.

> Projects written in **C** required a specific [coding norm](https://github.com/SaydRomey/42_ressources/blob/main/pdf/norm_en_v4.pdf)

### Exams
- **[Exam Repository](https://github.com/SaydRomey/exams)**: Personal solutions for 42 exams with an exam simulator.

## About Me (long)

Hi! I'm a passionate developer with a love for problem-solving and learning new technologies.  
I am a student at 42 Québec, where I am developping my technical and collaborative skills through intensive project-based learning.

I am proficient in C/C++ (C++98) and possess a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles.

I am a firm believer in clean, modular, and scalable code, and have a deep appreciation for automation.  
I extensively use Makefiles and Bash scripting to streamline workflows, generate assets and enhance development efficiency.

I also enjoy creating reusable utility classes and wrapper functions to enhance code readability and maintainability.
