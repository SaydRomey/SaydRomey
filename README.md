# Hello, World!

### I'm Ced, a junior dev and alumni from [42 Québec](https://www.42quebec.com)

🌱 I’m currently learning **Videogame Programming**  

Take a look at my current project [GodotPlayground](https://github.com/SaydRomey/GodotPlayground)  
I'm also world-building some color-related lore and ideas: [ColorGame](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ColorGame)  
> [!NOTE]
> (The ColorGame repo might be private at the moment... work in progress and all, you know.)

## About Me

Hi! I'm a passionate developer with a love for problem-solving and learning new technologies.  
I studied at 42 Québec, where I developped my technical and collaborative skills through intensive project-based learning.

I am proficient in C/C++ (C++98) and possess a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles.

I am a firm believer in clean, modular, and scalable code, and have a deep appreciation for automation.  
I extensively use Makefiles and Bash scripting to streamline workflows, generate assets and enhance development efficiency.

I also enjoy creating reusable utility classes and wrapper functions to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Most Recent Project
**[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_transcendence)**

I recently completed 42's final common core project.  
A secure web application combining authentication with 2FA, user management, GDPR features, in the format of a Pong-inspired game, built with modern web technologies.

I am also documenting my previous projects on my github,  
getting familiar with markdown and a little html in the process!
