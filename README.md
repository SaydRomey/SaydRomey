# Hello, World!

### I'm Ced, a programming student at [42 Québec](https://www.42quebec.com)

## Currently Working On
**[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_transcendence)**

I am currently working on  42's final project before completing the common core.  
A real-time multiplayer web application combining authentication, chat, and a Pong-inspired game, built with modern web technologies.

I am also documenting my previous projects on my github,  
getting familiar with markdown and a little html in the process!
