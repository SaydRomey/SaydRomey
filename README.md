## About Me (long)

Hi! I'm a passionate developer with a love for problem-solving and learning new technologies.  
I am a student at 42 Québec, where I am developping my technical and collaborative skills through intensive project-based learning.

I am proficient in C/C++ (C++98) and possess a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles.

I am a firm believer in clean, modular, and scalable code, and have a deep appreciation for automation.  
I extensively use Makefiles and Bash scripting to streamline workflows, generate assets and enhance development efficiency.

I also enjoy creating reusable utility classes and wrapper functions to enhance code readability and maintainability.
