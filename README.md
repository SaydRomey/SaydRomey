## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a junior developer with a passion for clean, modular, and scalable code.  
At [42 Québec](https://www.42quebec.com), I grew strong in problem-solving, project-based learning, and technical teamwork.

**Languages & Tools I Use Most**:  
C, C++, Bash, TypeScript, Makefiles, Git, Docker

I love automating workflows, writing utility scripts, and building reusable components — whether for shell scripts or game dev experiments.

<!--
Hi! I'm a passionate developer with a love for problem-solving and learning new technologies.  
I studied at 42 Québec, where I developped my technical and collaborative skills through intensive project-based learning.

I am proficient in C/C++ (C++98) and possess a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles.

I am a firm believer in clean, modular, and scalable code, and have a deep appreciation for automation.  
I extensively use Makefiles and Bash scripting to streamline workflows, generate assets and enhance development efficiency.

I also enjoy creating reusable utility classes and wrapper functions to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## 🎮 Current Projects

### [ColorGame](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ColorGame)  
I'm building a color-themed universe for a future video game — from lore and mythology to NPC archetypes and core mechanics.  

> [NOTE!]  
> *(The ColorGame repo might be private at the moment... work in progress and all, you know.)*  


### [GodotPlayground](https://github.com/SaydRomey/GodotPlayground)  
An experimental space for gameplay mechanics, level design, and scripting in Godot.

> I am also documenting my previous projects on my github,  
> getting familiar with markdown and a little html in the process!
