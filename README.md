# Hello World!
I'm Ced, a programming student at [42 Québec](https://www.42quebec.com)  

## Currently Working On
I am currently working on **[ft_transcendance](https://github.com/SaydRomey/ft_transcendance)**,  
42's final project before completing the common core.  
A real-time multiplayer web application combining authentication, chat, and a Pong-inspired game, built with modern web technologies.

The **42 Common Core** is a rigorous, peer-driven curriculum focusing on low-level programming, algorithms, and systems development.
